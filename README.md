# unHack - jekyll for non-hackers

The Goal is to create a GUI for the static site generator jekyll as an Electron App

This is my Bachelor's Thesis Project.

**still in Development**

# Beta One now released! check releases Tab for downloads.

## Documentation
An Overview over the App and [Docs](https://unhacked.halfapx.com/docs/) can be found on the Project's Website.


<!-- # Config File
The `unhack.json` file is key for every unHack project. Within this File Information for Publication will be stored, as well as Configuration for the Theme Front Matter.

## Name
Every projects does minimally need a name

```json
{
  "name": "YOUR SITES NAME HERE",
}
```

## Publication Settings
These settings are automatically created if they aren't already in the file. But if you want to set them up via JSON this is how it's done.
`method` is the currently active method, so either enter `ftp` or `gitHub`.

```json
{
  "publicationSettings": {
    "ftp": {
      "ftpHost": "",
      "ftpUsername": "",
      "ftpPort": "",
      "ftpDirectory": ""
    },
    "gitHub": {
      "gitHubUsername": "",
      "gitHubUserEmail": "",
      "gitHubRepoName": ""
    },
    "method": ""
  }
}
```

## Navigation Builder
In order to support the custom Menu Builder, the config file needs to contain.
How the Navigation Builder works and how to properly integrate it into your theme is covered in the Theme Compatibility section.

```json
{
  "menuSupport": "true"
}
```

# Theme Compatibility
unHack offers a couple customizing Options within it's Configuration file. To make your Theme compatible with unHack out of the box, make sure to add a `unhack.json` file. -->
